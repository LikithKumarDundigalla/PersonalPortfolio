        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            I remember watching The Social Dilemma on Netflix—it was all about how platforms keep us hooked. But while most people focused on the addictive nature of social media, I was more fascinated by the tech behind it. The way data was being used to drive recommendations and engagement blew my mind. That’s what got me interested in data.
<br>
            <br>I started off as a Data Engineer, working with massive amounts of data, building pipelines, and optimizing data flow. Along the way, I also got into data analysis and built dashboards to derive insights, helping teams make better decisions. But over time, I realized my role was mostly about handling the initial stages of data—moving it, transforming it, and storing it. I wanted to go beyond that. I wanted to understand how data could be used to make predictions, drive decisions, and power AI-driven systems.
<br>
            <br>That’s when I decided to dive deeper and pursue my Master’s in Data Science. During my studies, I worked on projects involving machine learning, natural language processing, transformers, and large language models (LLMs). Learning how AI interprets and generates language, how models like GPT and BERT work, and how data science can be applied in real-world scenarios was a game-changer for me.
<br>
            <br>Now, with experience in both data engineering and data science, I see the bigger picture—how raw data transforms into meaningful insights and AI-driven solutions. And that’s exactly what keeps me passionate about this field.
